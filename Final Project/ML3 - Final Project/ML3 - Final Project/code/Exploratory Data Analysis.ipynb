      "I babysit my cousins sometimes. They are way younger them me so I can tell them what to do. I usually watch over them and give them lunch. They play and watch TV. I am just there to make sure that they do not harm themselves. he have become used to me and treat me as an adult. They do not cause much trouble but would sometimes feel a strong dislike towards me when I don't let hem do something because its harmful. They forget about it quickly but hey give me trouble and do not talk to me for a while. I can control their behaviors by threatening them with time out or no TV.

      "I helped to evaluate students to see if they would be fit for a program called CIVITAS at my high school.  We interview incoming freshman and ask them about their interests to see if they would excel in our program.  The freshman are always nervous when they first come in the room, so I want to make the environment as comforting as possible.  Welcoming them is important and when I went through the same process I remember being really scared.  Most of them don't have the same communication skills however which makes it hard to talk to them.  I feel like I had to press the information out of them sometimes.  The students who answered questions fully and took a lot of time in the room were my favorite because they had a conversation with us rather than answering the questions briefly to finish the interview.  It is a lot of power to have over these students because I am deciding their future at Rio, so I feel like the evaluators were always very friendly and wanting them to do well in the interview so that they could join our program.                                                                                                                                                1\n",

      "When I was in a position of power, I was captain of my high school's lacrosse team. In this position, I conducted practices, with the consent of the coach, to my own discretion in preparation for the next game. Though the thought of having the responsibility to lead the team was intimidating, I overcame my nerves and lead the team in a manner that I felt fit best. I felt that my duty was to encourage my teammates, as well as to establish discipline when the coach was talking. I usually was picked to go first in drills or used as the example; since I had more experience than most other players on the team and because I was captain for two years, I was confident and did not fear the attention. As captain, another duty was to be the \"middle-man\" between the coach and the players; so I was, essentially, representing the players and the coach and reporting to one about the other. One incident in particular was when I was asked by my coach to represent the lacrosse team at a school board meeting. I had the power to say anything that would affect outsiders' thoughts on the team's performance. I initially felt a lot of pressure, but when I went up to the podium, I was calm.       1\n",

I became aware of how people thought of me and changed the way I spoke and directed individuals because I did not want to abuse my power or offend anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

      "I was a stage manager. I was constantly concerned about the emotional state the my crew was  under. I understood that the time we put in was very difficult combined with academics and that our director was not always emotionally supportive. So I was constantly trying to make up for what they were lacking from her. When I had to be strict or stern it worried me because what I wanted was better or more efficient work, and not to lose a friend. Although I had come to the conclusion that a friend would understand the postion I was in. It was very pleasing and satisfying to see the end product (the play and all its components) and to see everyone so pleased with what we had accomplished, and pleased with their individual work.

He wanted to be with her but he did not want to risk losing the friendship. So I decided to talk to Taylor on how she felt about the situation and she did not want to lose him as a friend either. I ended up getting them to go on a double date with me to see if anything was easier. It got a little easier as the week went on. Then I told my friend Zack he needed to ask her out already and just see how being boyfriend and girlfriend would feel. I said if you never try you will never know how you guys truly feel.

      "While babysitting middleschool aged children, I experienced difficulty in using my power effectively.  While their parents had told them that I was clearly the person in position of power, as I was being paid to watch them, the oldest felt that they were in power because they did not need someone to watch over them and were fully capable of creating rules and providing for themself.  It was extreemly frustrating having no control over the childs want for independence and clear disregard for my rules and demands.  While trying to keep the child safe and happy, I lost control over my position of power and did not know what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "I was a county captain for my golf team, which meant that I arranged meetings to hear peoples' voices and I was able to change things if there were any problems causing upset within my team and the county. I was happy that I had been chosen to be captain as it was a big role and quite difficult to make everyone happy.

      "In high school, I wrote and directed a musical for the theater department.  The cast was pretty large (around 40 members).  I was excited to be able to direct and guide the students to put on the show the way I wanted it to be, but I was also overwhelmed at having to deal with so many people.  I was constantly stressed out at having to plan rehearsals that would work with everyone's schedules.  In addition, being in charge of the set, lighting, decorations, costumes, ticket sales and so much more just added even more stress.  It was definitely an experience that put me under a lot of pressure, but I enjoyed being the leader and having control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "One time when I was babysitting my niece and nephew they were being very destructive and loud. One of them was crying and the other was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. I told them that if they were to be good, meaning that they would calm down and sit quietly and be respectful, they would earn a prize such as candy, or extra tv time. They really wanted to have candy so I could tell that they were going to try their hardest to listen to me. I told them that if they were to be bad even once more, that they would not get either prize and would be sent to bed. You could tell that they were determined to be good, despite the prior events. In the end, they chose to settle down and be nice to one another. They earned their reward and were extremely happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

I gathered volunteers and administered three tests, sparing the details of the test exactly i had a baseline, and then one I'd administer positive reinforcement (doughnut) and one where I'd administer punishment (electric shock).

It was fun to watch them fight over the candy bad that I had not wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

      "I am in this position pretty often.  I was recently promoted to the hardest position at my job during the holiday season.  Because I was promoted to such an important position, I have to constantly be in power over them as well as constantly evaluate those individuals.  Being new to the job, my boss hired seasonal employee's, but now I am in a position where I need to constantly evaluate them in order to determine whether they stay post-holiday season, or if they are let go.  For one of my employees, I feel terrible because she says she is homeless, but she does not perform as well as she should if she wants to keep the job.  Therefore, I feel bad giving her a negative evaluation and letting her go after Christmas, but she shows negative behaviors by calling out often (usually on weekends,) using foul language, and being inappropriate in the work setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

      "I definitely felt that my band director had power and control over me when I was part of my high school's concert and marching band. He would hold evaluations at least twice a month where he would examine out ability to play the music for that week as well as evaluate how well we could read rhythm and \"sight read\". He had control over the music, the choreography for the show and the activities that the band had to do. I certainly didn't agree with him on everything he chose for me. For example, he demoted and promoted me in terms of whether I was first or second chair several times and he also chose not to name me drum major. My reaction was that of frustration, but I tried to keep it to myself since I knew that he had much more experience in this field than I did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Being an athlete I've always had a coach over powering me. Whether I wanted to play in a situation, or rest I had little to no say about it. My coach always had the final say over me and the rest of my team's actions.

      "I played golf for my high school golf team and in my second year the coach decided to take another player to a tournament. At that tournament that player performed poorly and then the coach decided to take that same player to another tournament the next week over me again. Again that player performed poorly in the tournament. I felt that the coach decided who he wanted even if they were not playing better at the time of the tournament. It felt like he was playing favorites and I was the one that was left out. Later in the season I ended up winning one of the bigger tournaments that we played in and I got no recognition from the golf coach. It felt like he was trying to help some of his players to play better and had no confidence in other players which caused a lack of leadership on the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

The majority of our group (consisted of four) strongly felt that the use of a certain motif was prevalent in the book we were analyzing. However, our group leader thought otherwise. Being the group leader, not only did he or she have the power to overrule our decisions, but also turned in an evaluation form of the group's compliance and work ethic. I was livid at the fact that our leader would use his or her position for personal benefit, rather than thinking of the group as whole.

I ended up withdrawing from the class, to end up taking it again the next semester from a different professor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "When i was in the military service, my superior officers clearly had some power over me and i had to do anything they requested whether i liked it or not. It was a crime to disobey my officers in military and higher rank officers can demote, humiliate, and they could even send me to jail when they feel dishonored. So whenever i was told to do something that i didn't want to do, i felt so miserable trying to realize where i actually belong.

I recognized I didn't mean more to him, then he did to me--I immediately stopped having romantic feelings for him and discontinued speaking to him via text/phone calls.

      "My friend had taken my stuffed animal once so, I went to his dorm room to get it back. When I walked over to his room and demanded it back, I felt very empowered and intimidating. My friend seemed to be scared and I thought I had won and was going to get my stuffed animal back. I lunged at my friend to retrieve the toy, but when I did, he picked me up and carried me out of his room all the way back to my room at the opposite end of the hall. When this happened I felt extremely embarrassed and weak, especially because my friend is a very skinny and not particularly muscular individual. I am very used to being around people who think that I am weak because I am a female and because I am short, but usually I am able to prove them wrong with my independent self-confident attitude. I had always liked to believe that I am stronger than I look, and this is true to an extent, but when someone is able to physically lift my entire body off the ground, it makes me feel like I have no control and I do not like it, it makes me feel weak, and acts as a major hit to my pride.       1\n",

       "I played golf for my high school golf team and in my second year the coach decided to take another player to a tournament. At that tournament that player performed poorly and then the coach decided to take that same player to another tournament the next week over me again. Again that player performed poorly in the tournament. I felt that the coach decided who he wanted even if they were not playing better at the time of the tournament. It felt like he was playing favorites and I was the one that was left out. Later in the season I ended up winning one of the bigger tournaments that we played in and I got no recognition from the golf coach. It felt like he was trying to help some of his players to play better and had no confidence in other players which caused a lack of leadership on the team.       1\n",
